                <h1>Residency permit obtained from property acquisition: conditions, price and costs</h1>
                <p>A residency in Georgia attracts many property investors. The idea of moving to Georgia has become
                    popular among people living in CIS countries. However, nowadays, many European and American citizens
                    consider Georgia to be an attractive place to move to permanently. A residence permit in Georgia
                    allows foreigners to have the same rights as the Georgians, simplifies border crossing process and
                    other formalities. What are the types of residency possible and how an investor can obtain it – will
                    be discussed in this article.
                </p>
                <h2>What does Georgian residency offer and who can obtain it</h2>
                <p>A residence permit is a legal document that allows a foreign citizen entering into various legal
                    relationships on the territory of Georgia, have access to banking, medical, insurance and other
                    services. Moreover, residency is the first step of becoming a Georgian citizen. The residence permit
                    allows you to get a Georgian passport after ten years of living in the country. However, a residency
                    permit has its restrictions – unlike citizens of the country, residents are unable to take part in
                    political elections, referendums and votes. But these nuances are not that important for those who
                    wish to open up their business in Georgia, purchase property for commercial or personal use.
                </p>
                <p>The Georgian Government developed a special legislative framework for a simplified obtaining of a
                    residence permit. And only by following the law, one can receive permission to reside in the
                    country. It relates to both temporary and permanent residence permits in Georgia. A temporary
                    residence permit is issued only for the period of one year; however, any non-resident has the
                    opportunity to renew it. After five years of living in the country with a temporary permit, the law
                    allows you to get a permanent residence permit. It is available for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Employees, freelancers;</li>
                    <li>Investors, entrepreneurs;</li>
                    <li>Students of higher education and school;</li>
                    <li>Family reunification candidates;</li>
                    <li>Former citizens of Georgia;</li>
                    <li>People without citizenship;</li>
                    <li>Owners of property (other than land plots) worth more than 35,000 US dollars.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A residence permit is also issued to spouses, family members, and parents of those, who lived in
                    Georgia no less than six years. However, this six-year period does not include periods of medical
                    treatment, diplomatic service and study. If a non-resident is actively investing in the Georgian
                    economy, he then has the right to apply for a residence permit. As a rule, the amount of such
                    investments needs to start from $ 122,000 (300,000 of the national currency - lari).
                </p>
                <h2>What are the types of residence permits in Georgia?</h2>
                <p>Getting a residency in Georgia is relatively easy. After a foreign citizen makes an investment or
                    begins an economic activity, he then can apply for a residence permit at any authorised
                    representative office: the territorial office of the Agency for the Development of Public Services
                    or a branch of the Centre for Public Services. The application and all related documents can be in
                    Georgian, English and/or Russian.
                </p>
                <p> There are two kinds of permits:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Permanent;</li>
                    <li>Temporary</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Permanent Residence Permit</h3>
                <p>Can be obtained by a foreigner whose spouse, father or mother are Georgian citizens that live in the
                    country legally for at least six years. In this case, you will need a document confirming the
                    official income of the applicant.
                </p>
                <h4>Based on temporary residence permits</h4>
                <p> Can be obtained by a foreigner who lived in Georgia for at least six years on the basis of temporary
                    permits. The length of stay is calculated based on the total period of validity of temporary
                    residence permits and not on the actual stay in the country’s territories. The permits issued for
                    study, medical treatment or to work in diplomatic missions are not to be considered for the
                    permanent resident visa.
                </p>
                <h4>Based on family ties</h4>
                <p>Parents, children and spouses of Georgian citizens have the right to get a permanent residence
                    permit. The only requirement is to present a document confirming family ties. The nuance of such
                    residence permit is that in the event of a divorce, it gets cancelled.
                </p>
                <h4>Special</h4>
                <p>This type of residence permit does not have a validity period and is issued to foreign citizens who
                    became victims of human trafficking. It can be given with the initiative of a Georgian Government
                    member, compatriots living abroad, or individuals whose deportation from the country could threaten
                    their lives.
                </p>
                <h3>Temporary Residence Permit</h3>
                <p>A temporary residence permit is issued to people who are planning to conduct business or work under
                    an employment contract. An applicant travelling to Georgia for work must submit an employment
                    contract for at least 6 months with a minimum wage of 1,000 GEL per month. The company employing him
                    must have a turnover of at least 50,000 lari. Business people and entrepreneurs who registered a
                    company in Georgia need to deposit at least USD 5,000 to the company’s account before applying for a
                    temporary residence. Citizens of countries that have a visa-free regime with Georgia must have a D1
                    / D2 immigrant visa. The fees will vary depending on the period for issuing the permit. The
                    application can also be submitted remotely by a proxy.
                </p>
                <h4>Work residence permit</h4>
                <p>The work residence permit is issued to foreign citizens who arrived in Georgia to conduct labour
                    activities under an official contract with an employer.
                </p>
                <h4>For Sole Traders</h4>
                <p>This type of residency is granted to individuals who have registered a business in Georgia. The
                    company registration process is very simple:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>takes around one day;</li>
                    <li>costs about 35 dollars (100 lari);</li>
                    <li>open a corporate account in any Georgian bank;</li>
                    <li>obtain a taxpayer identification number (TIN).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are a few crucial figures that are important for a company-investor. The annual turnover of the
                    founded company must exceed 50,000 lari (equivalent to 17,000 US dollars). The monthly income from
                    this entrepreneurial activity of the founder or founders must be at least five times the minimum
                    wage of a citizen of Georgia. According to the current legislation, this residence permit is issued
                    for the period of one year, but the period might change, as the Georgian Government may amend the
                    by-laws. In any case, the term cannot exceed six years.
                </p>
                <p>Primary documents, required to obtain an entrepreneurial residence permit:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An extract from the register of enterprises of legal entities;</li>
                    <li>A certificate from the tax office that the company’s turnover is at least 50,000 lari per year;
                    </li>
                    <li>A bank statement stating that the director of the company holds at least 11,000 lari in his
                        account;</li>
                    <li>A notice stating the total number of foreign employees in the company.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The founders of the company can renew the residence permit each year if they meet all of the above
                    conditions. After extending it for 6 years, the temporary investor can apply for a permanent
                    residence permit.
                </p>
                <h4>Study Permit</h4>
                <p>The permit can be granted for students at schools and higher education institutes, which are under
                    the patronage of the Ministry of Education of Georgia on the territory of another state. The period
                    of such a residence permit is equivalent to the period of school study or university contract. In
                    order to apply for it, a student will require a bank statement confirming the availability of funds
                    for the student’s accommodation in Georgia for the period of study.

                <h4>Investment</h4>
                <p>This type of permit is issued to a foreign citizen who contributed to the Georgian economy for the
                    amount of at least USD 300,000 or owns a property (except for agriculture lands) valued at an
                    equivalent amount on the country’s territory. In this case, an investor receives a temporary
                    residence permit for the period up to five years. The owner of an investment residence permit must
                    provide information on income from commercial activities every year and prove that the annual
                    turnover exceeds:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>50,000 USD - in the 1st year;</li>
                    <li>100,000 USD - in the 2nd year;</li>
                    <li>120,000 USD - from the 3rd to the 5th year.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the event of an investment residence permit being based on the ownership of a real estate, an
                    individual retains ownership of the property that was the reason for issuing a residence permit.
                </p>
                <h4>With the purpose of family reunification</h4>
                <p>A residence permit is granted to a foreign citizen’s family members, who hold a permanent residence
                    permit in Georgia. The validity period of such a residence permit is equivalent to the validity
                    period of the permit of the family member who received it first. In order to obtain it, you need to
                    submit a document confirming family relation, as well as a bank statement, the balance of which must
                    be twice the cost of living, considering the term of the residence permit.
                </p>
                <h4>A residence permit for property acquisition</h4>
                <p>This type of residency can be issued to owners of property that is valued at least USD 100,000.
                    Length of stay is one year. Similarly to the investment residence permit, the owner of such a permit
                    retains ownership of the property for one year. After one year, the foreigner must submit a document
                    confirming that he still owns the property and its minimum value exceeds USD 100,000.
                </p>
                <h2>Five steps to Georgian citizenship:</h2>
                <p>The residence permit application in Georgia is significantly easier than in developed countries such
                    as the USA, Canada, Australia or New Zealand. The immigration process in these countries might take
                    up to years, sometimes even decades. At the same time, you will have no guarantees of obtaining a
                    permanent residency or citizenship. It is quite common to hear a story about someone trying to get a
                    green card in the US for 15 years without success. Below are the steps that need to be undertaken on
                    the path to permanent residence and citizenship in Georgia.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 1: Visiting Georgia</h3>
                <p>Visiting the country is optional. The Georgian legislation allows the submission of documents for a
                    residence permit to be made remotely. However, it is recommended to spend a few days in the country
                    before moving or investing in property there.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 2: Choice of Residency</h3>
                <p>There are three ways of obtaining a residency, the choice of which depends on the financial
                    capabilities of an investor and how quickly he wishes to be granted one. Below are the advantages
                    and disadvantages of the three residence permit options.

                </p>
                <h3>Step 3: Investments</h3>
                <p>In order to make the investments of the required size, an individual can register a business and open
                    a commercial bank account or by acquiring property.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 4: Application for Residency</h3>
                <p>After investing funds, the applicant needs to collect all the necessary documents (more information
                    on this matter below) and apply for a residence permit at the territorial office of the Agency for
                    the Development of Public Services or a branch of the Public Services Center.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 5: Sending an application for citizenship</h3>
                <p>After living in Georgia for 5 years, an investor can apply for a permanent residence permit or
                    country’s citizenship. Dual citizenship is not allowed in Georgia; hence, a foreigner will have to
                    renounce the citizenship of his country. Obtaining citizenship is not mandatory, and a foreigner can
                    still run his business, study or work in Georgia for an indefinite period on the basis of a
                    permanent permit.
                </p>
                <h2>The procedure for obtaining a residence permit from investing into the real estate</h2>
                <p>Property investors can apply for a residence permit in Georgia right after the purchase of the real
                    estate.
                </p>
                <h3>Pre-registration of right to real estate</h3>
                <p>This procedure is required if an investor is acquiring real estate during the construction phase and
                    wishes to ensure his rights for the acquired property. In order to do this, the buyer concludes a
                    preliminary sales contract and registers it in the House of Justice. It will state the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>completion date of the object;</li>
                    <li>parameters of the acquired property;</li>
                    <li>property condition: finishing, plumbing, furniture, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most importantly – in the pre-registration agreement needs to include the obligation of the parties
                    to conclude the main contract after the commissioning of the object is prescribed.
                </p>
                <h3>Documents required for obtaining Residency in Georgia</h3>
                <p>To register property right, a foreign investor will need the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>passport;</li>
                    <li>purchase agreement or other document confirming the ownership of the property;</li>
                    <li>state duty payment receipt.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A power of attorney may also be required if a foreigner purchased his property remotely and the
                    transaction was concluded through a trusted person.
                </p>
                <h3>Timeframes of registration and the cost of obtaining a residence permit in Georgia</h3>
                <p>The speed of property rights registration in the Real Estate Register depends on the size of the
                    state fee that an investor is willing to pay:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>50 lari - four working days;</li>
                    <li>150 lari - the next day after filing the application;</li>
                    <li>200 lari - on the same day.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After obtaining both temporary and permanent residence permit, an individual has to register at the
                    place of residence in Georgia in order to receive a binadroba - an identity card with an ID number.
                    To do this, an application to the House of Justice needs to be sent within 30 days from the moment
                    of the first visit to the country.

                <p>The acquisition of property in Georgia is attractive not just because of a soft climate, tasty
                    cuisine and beautiful sights. Georgian real estate market remains one of the fastest-growing and
                    stable in the post-Soviet region even during the crisis. Apart from being granted a residency,
                    property acquisition is attractive due to the following aspects:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fast return on investment. Apartment and commercial property located in the centre of a large
                        city such as Tbilisi can bring up to 15% of net income annually from renting or up to 40% when
                        selling after 5 or 6 years after the acquisition. The average rental return is 6-8 years.</li>
                    <li>Low prices. Georgia remains one of a few resort countries where you can still buy property from
                        USD 1200 per square meter. Real estate by the sea in Georgia costs from 700-800 USD per square
                        meter if we are talking about Batumi. In other smaller cities and resort areas, housing prices
                        start at USD 300 per square meter. </li>
                    <li>Comfortable business climate. The Georgian Government strives to create the most comfortable
                        conditions for international investors by making residency obtaining procedures as easy as
                        possible. It also carries out reforms aimed at liberalising the economy and reducing
                        bureaucratic procedures for the business.</li>
                    <li>Security of investments. Individuals who are investing in property do not need to worry about
                        the security of their assets. A preliminary sales contract can be concluded even at the
                        construction stage, which guarantees the buyer the rights to the property and protects him from
                        unscrupulous developers. </li>
                    <li>Low tax rates. There is no property tax for individuals in Georgia. You only need to pay tax if
                        the amount of income from purchased property, for instance, when renting it out, exceeds 40,000
                        lari. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Another advantage of investing in Georgian real estate is simplicity. The procedure for drawing up a
                    contract and registering ownership of square meters can be carried out within one day. Whereas, to
                    purchase a property, you do not even need to visit the country. The main aspect is to find a
                    reliable intermediary who will take care of the formalities and guarantee the integrity of the
                    transaction.
                </p>
                <p>Developer Company Redco offers property at developer’s prices in Tbilisi, Batumi and other Georgian
                    cities with an option of a remote conclusion of a deal. You can find out more on the official
                    website of the developer - www.redco.ge.
