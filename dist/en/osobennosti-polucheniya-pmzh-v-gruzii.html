                <h1>Special features of obtaining permanent residency in Georgia</h1>
                <p>Georgia is a unique country, which is located in a junction of Europe and Asia. It has a deep centuries-old culture, wonderful nature, mild climate and warm-welcoming people, but most importantly, actively developing and open for investments economy. We will review the reasons why getting a permanent residency in Georgia is worthy and what is required in order to obtain it.</p>
                <h2>Reasons to choose Georgia for obtaining a permanent residency </h2>
                <p>Georgia stretches from west to east and is separated by Likhsky ridge and is surrounded by Greater Caucasian mountains. West Georgia differs from the Eastern with humid climate thanks to the Black Sea. There are many palm trees, tangerine gardens and tea plantations. National parks such as Okatse and Martvili canyons, waterfalls, caves are located in Western Georgia. Georgia attracts many tourists with its capital of Tbilisi, as well as the centre of winemaking – Kakheti, skiing and sea resorts. But these are not the only reasons why it is worth moving from Ukraine to Georgia for permanent residency.</p>
                <h3>Climate and Nature</h3>
                <p>Georgia's topography is very diverse. The predominant feature is mountains, which overrun almost 85% of the country. The Greater Caucasus rises along the northern part, and its highest peaks are Shkhara (5200 meters) and Kazbek (5037 meters). Many of the peaks reach an altitude of more than 4,5 kilometres. The lower Lesser Caucasus rises over the southern border of the country, the peaks of which barely rise over three kilometres. There are more than 25,000 rivers in Georgia that fall into either the Black Sea in the west or the Caspian Sea in the east. The most significant river is Mtkvari (Kura), which flows through Tbilisi, originates in Turkey and flows through eastern Georgia to the Caspian Sea.</p>
                <p>The climate varies from subtropical on the Black Sea's coast to continental in eastern regions of the country. The mountains protect the country from cold air masses coming from the north; therefore, the climate in the western part of the country is warm and humid with the amount of rainfall from 1000 to 2500 millimetres per annum. The average temperature during winter is 5  °C and in summer - 22  °C. Average annual temperature in Georgia is 12,7  °C. The climatic zones depending on the altitude and the distance from the Black Sea. The northern part of the country experiences much less rainfall - an average of 560 millimetres per year, the average temperature in winter is 2-4  ° C, in summer 20-24  ° C. Semi-arid plains and highlands in the southeast have their microclimate: the amount of rainfall in the mountains maybe twice as much as in the flat part of the country. The highest mountain peaks are always covered with snow.</p>
                <p>Georgia is open to tourists all year around. During the summertime, you may travel to the sea, health resorts or natural parks. Whereas in winter, tourists travel to the mountains for skiing. There are five skiing resorts in total.</p>
                <h3>Society</h3>
                <p>Georgian people are very welcoming and are happy to greet tourists as their friends and family. A guest, for any Georgian person, is the main person, and they consider it is their duty to be as hospitable as possible.</p>
                <p>The Georgians are the largest ethnic group in the country. According to the population census of 2014, there are 3 224 564 Georgians. However, there are various ethnical minorities as well. The largest of them are Azerbaijanis (233,024), Armenians (168,102), Russians (26,453), Ossetians (14,385), Ukrainians (6,034), Greeks (5,544). The vast majority of Azeri minority lives in the region of Kvemo Kartli, Armenians make up the largest group in Samtskhe-Javakheti. Other minority groups live mainly in Tbilisi, but also Kakheti and Batumi. Slightly more than half of Georgians live in the cities such as Tbilisi - just over 1,000,000 residents, Kutaisi - 200,000, Batumi - about 150,000 residents. The population is mainly concentrated in the valley between the Greater and Lesser Caucasus and the Black Sea coast. The population density is relatively high but still less than in nearby Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
                <h3>Education and Healthcare</h3>
                <p>Thanks to the reforms of the year of 2003, Georgia has a relatively highly developed healthcare and education. These reforms not only helped to modernize old hospitals and schools but also build a large number of new educational and healthcare institutions. Medicine in Georgia is paid, but first aid is provided free of charge. The academic sphere is also paid. A month of studying in a pre-school institution is about 280 lari, in an elementary school - 7800 lari, at a university - from 13,000 lari per year. Higher education diplomas in Georgia are valid in the CIS countries and Europe.</p>
                <h3>Cost of living</h3>
                <p>The overall standard of living in the country is a lot higher than the average in CIS countries. The monthly spending for a family of four is around 4,620 lari excluding rent, at the same time spending for a single person is 1,318.60 lari. The cost of living index in Tbilisi is 11.62% lower than in Kyiv, at the same time the rental price is 30.37% lower. Today, the prices for public transport and taxi in Georgia are relatively low in comparison to Ukraine. For example, a ride on a bus or subway will be only 50 tetri (about 5 hryvnias). Moreover, within an hour you can make changes from one type of transport to another for free.</p>
                <p>The cost of living in Georgia can be calculated using the example of the main cost items:</p>

                <p>Georgia is a high-income country in comparison to its neighbours Armenia and Azerbaijan. In 2018, the GDP grew by 5,1%. From 2006 to 2007, the economy has been steadily increasing by approximately 10 per cent annually, and the World Bank named Georgia the "Innovator of the Year". Nowadays, due to quarantine restrictions associated with COVID-19, the growth of country's GDP slowed down and according to forecasts will be around 5% in 2021.</p>
                <h2>Advantages of permanent residency in Georgia for a foreigner</h2>
                <p>Georgia offers visas, residence permits and status of tax resident for investors and property owners with a possibility to obtain citizenship in future.</p>
                <h3>Unlimited stay in the country</h3>
                <p> A residence permit in Georgia gives the right for an unlimited stay in the country and the right to engage in any lawful activity, such as running a business, working, studying or simply retiring without a right for work or any other documents. Georgian citizens are not obliged to carry out military service.</p>
                <h3>Investment possibilities</h3>
                <p>There are various ways of successfully investing money, for example, tourism, agriculture, manufacturing or real estate. The government offers a number of benefits and grants, simplified taxation and various preferences for foreign investors, which bring down the costs of running a business or purchasing a property.</p>
                <h3>More freedoms and possibilities</h3>
                <p>Georgia is considered one of the safest countries in the world, with one of the lowest levels of criminal activity in the world. If economic or political situations get worse in your country, you can move your family to Georgia with your residence permit. Having a residence permit can help you avoid the foreign policy or domestic legislation problems in your country.</p>
                
                <h3>Extension of immigration benefits to family members</h3>
                <p>Georgia issues a "residence permit for family reunification" for family members, including spouses, children, parents, minors, supported or disabled individuals who are under guardianship or utterly dependent on the holder of the residence permit. In case you wish to travel to Europe or other countries, the residence permit will enable you to apply for a visa in the Georgian embassy.</p>
                <h3>Absence of tax on foreign income</h3>
                <p>The income of individuals from foreign sources are not subject to taxation in Georgia even if you are a tax resident of the country. A tax residency certificate can be issued to foreigners that spend more than 183 days a year in Georgia.</p>
                <h3>Government support</h3>
                <p>Georgian residents are exploiting their constitutional rights and freedoms, including the right for work, healthcare, social welfare, education, property rights, privacy, freedom of speech, conscience, religion or belief. Georgia has a number of social programs for its residents, including state-funded education and healthcare, social benefits for elderly, disabled and other categories of socially vulnerable groups of the population.</p>
                <h3>Super quick and easy business registration</h3>
                <p>The registration of a company can be done within a day if you are physically present in Georgia and use samples of registration documents. If documents are set up or in case of remote registration (by power of attorney), the process may take slightly longer. It usually takes a day to open a business bank account. You are required to present a small set of documents, such as passports of shareholders and directors.</p>
                <h3>Low tax rates for entrepreneurs</h3>
                <p>The rate of corporate tax in Georgia is only 15%. However, the company is not required to pay tax for the obtained income until the profits have been distributed. The status of a zero-tax is available for CIS and IT companies. Sole traders with annual sales volume less than 30,000 lari (10,135 US dollars) are released from taxes. Sole traders with the annual sales volume of less than 500,000 lari (167,000 US dollars) are taxed at 1% on their sales. Dividends are typically taxed at a rate of 5%; however, the rate can be lower due to double taxation treaties.</p>
                <h3>Way to Permanent Residence Permit</h3>
                <p>Once you become a Georgian resident, you and your family can apply for citizenship. Georgian passport takes 53rd place in the world and allows visa-free travel to 116 countries and territories, including EU countries (Schengen), most of CIS countries, Iran and Turkey.</p>
                <h2>Nuances of granting a permanent residence permit</h2>
                <p>The Ministry of Justice takes care of issuing residency to foreign citizens. In order to obtain a residency, you will need to apply with a set of documents and undergo an interview in the department of immigration. The decision takes around a month, and the result is published on the Civil registry of the country's official website. Even if all conditions are met, a refusal may be possible in case an applicant:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Has a criminal record;</li>
                <li>Provided false information about himself;</li>
                <li>Suffers from severe and potentially dangerous diseases;</li>
                <li>Had been deported from the country in the past.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In other cases, if the candidate truthfully fulfilled the required conditions, there should not be any difficulties to get a residency.</p>
                <h2>Required documents</h2>
                <p>You can apply for residency in person or with a proxy mediator, having previously translated it into Georgian and certified by a notary. The package of documents includes:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Birth certificate;</li>
                <li>Document confirming marital status;</li>
                <li>A Copy or an original of travel document;</li>
                <li>2 passport photographs;</li>
                <li>Bank statement confirming financial status;</li>
                <li>Documents confirming the right to stay in Georgia;</li>
                <li>Certificate of no criminal record;</li>
                <li>Invitation (if you have one).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A foreign citizen is required to live in the country as a temporary resident for at least three years to obtain official residency: an exemption refugees, repatriates, investors and people who married a Georgian citizen. Upon getting a permanent residence, a foreigner needs to pass Georgian language and history exams, after he will become a full-fledged resident of Georgia and will receive the same rights as Georgian citizens, except for the opportunity to participate in elections.</p>
